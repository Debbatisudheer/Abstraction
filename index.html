  <p>Between you and the bot, there is an abstraction called encryption and Decryption, so there is no need to worry about its implementation.</p>
   <p>For Cryptography code, you can <a href="https://github.com/Debbatisudheer/Abstraction/blob/master/abstraction.py">click here</a>.</p>

  <!-- Information about Abstraction -->
  <div id="abstraction-info">
    <h2>Abstraction in Cryptographic Operations</h2>
    <p>
      Abstraction plays a crucial role in hiding the low-level details of cryptographic operations
      and providing a simplified interface for users. In a similar way, this chat application abstracts
      away the complexities of message encryption and decryption, allowing users to interact with a
      straightforward interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      The encryption process involves secure key exchange, symmetric encryption, initialization vectors,
      and other cryptographic details. Abstraction ensures that users only need to focus on sending
      and receiving messages without delving into the intricate workings of the underlying security measures.

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Password Derivation Function (PBKDF2):</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> The use of the PBKDF2HMAC function abstracts the process of deriving a key from the user's password. Users interact with a simple function call, specifying the password and obtaining the derived key.</li>
      <li><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong> Imagine you have a password, and you want to turn it into a secret key for encryption. The PBKDF2HMAC function is like a magic tool that takes your password and converts it into a secure key without you needing to worry about the technical details.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Cipher and Encryption/Decryption:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> The Cipher class, along with algorithms and modes, abstracts the complexities of implementing cryptographic ciphers. Users interact with a simplified API for encryption and decryption without needing to deal with the intricate details of block cipher modes, padding, and other cryptographic considerations.</li>
      <li><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong> Now, let's say you want to lock and unlock a message with a secret code. The Cipher class and related stuff handle the locking and unlocking process for you. You don't have to figure out how to do it; you just say, "lock" or "unlock."</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Initialization Vector (IV) and Authentication Tag:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> The library handles the creation and management of the initialization vector (IV) and the authentication tag for the AES-GCM mode. Users do not need to implement these components manually.</li>
      <li><strong>Simple Explanation: </strong>When you lock and unlock your message, there are additional secret things called the "IV" and "tag" that help keep everything secure. The library takes care of creating and using these secret things, and you don't have to worry about what they are exactly.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Error Handling and Security Considerations:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> The library includes error handling and security features that are abstracted from the user. For example, the library manages the authentication tag in a way that helps ensure the integrity of the ciphertext.</li>
      <li><strong>Simple Explanation:</strong> Sometimes, things might not go as planned, or there could be bad guys trying to mess with your locked message. The library has built-in protections to handle these situations and keep your messages safe without you having to be a security expert.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>In simple terms, the cryptography library provides tools (functions and classes) that do complicated security tasks for you. You just tell them what you want (like "lock this message" or "unlock this message"), and the library takes care of the rest, making sure your messages stay safe and sound.</p>
